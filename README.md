# SQL-Employee-Tracker

Module 12 we were required to make an employee tracker using the SQL method. To start the inquirer package and the mysql2 package are needed to create this database. After creating all the base code you begin by logging into mysql terminal and source Schema.sql and Seeds.sql. From there you will exit back to the main terminal and run the Main.js server from there you will be able to view all employees, all departments, and all roles, along with who the employee reports to and what their salary is. The user will also be able to create a new department, roll, and add new employees to their database.
